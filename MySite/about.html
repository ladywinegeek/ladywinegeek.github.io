      <h2>About</h1> 
      </br>
      <h3>Hi! I&#39;m a user experience designer based in Chicago.</h3>
      </br>
      <p>The road to UX for me was long and winding. But I didn&#39;t mind. I&#39;m a traveler at heart, a lover of stories, and new places.</p> 
      </br>
      <p>I moved around the midwest a lot when I was a kid so I learned to turn the unknown into my comfort zone. In college I studied History in Swansea, Wales, home of rugged greenery and bizarre accents. I traveled on weekends and discovered the best coffee in the world in a tiny hotel in Florence and some of the best museums in Berlin.</p> 
      </br>
      <p>Once I finished school in Green Bay, I moved to Chicago, where I did research for a consulting firm and wrote stories on the side for a couple years before moving to China to teach English in a town called Anyang, long ago the capital of China. It doesn&#39;t have much now besides a lot of people and two museums dedicated to the Chinese language. Chinese characters first took shape here, scratched into bones and tortoise shells.</p>
      </br>
      <p>I taught university students. Some, like my English majors, were practically fluent in English and other&#39;s like my Art majors, could barely say one full sentence. Still, their English was miles better than my Chinese.</p>
      </br>
      <p>I traveled a lot in China too: to the Great Wall at the North Korean border and south, to the mountains where I saw Burma from across a field. I struggled to speak the Chinese I knew and found that pointing is a very effective way of communicating.</p> 
      </br>
      <p>In China, I learned this surprising truth: not all people think the same way or hold the same values. A point of view I dont understand is still a valid point of view, but it requires more patience, more listening, more empathy, to get to a place where you might begin to understand a little. Sometimes, it takes a lot of patience.</p>
      </br>
      <p>I returned from China and took a job as an editor at a huge web company. I liked my work just fine, like how one likes toast for breakfast. I missed working with people so I started a professional development book club at the company and took a leadership position in one of the employee resource groups.</p>
      </br>
      <p>Throughout all of this time, I continued writing and reading. I was fascinated by other&#39;s stories and how we use those stories to connect and understand each other.</p>
      </br>
      <p>I couldn&#39;t use much of these skills correcting copy, so I looked for other kinds of jobs. I also wanted to keep learning. I loved collaborating with others, especially with those who have different skill sets. We all have our own perspective, and combining the brains of a bunch of smart, creative, driven people is powerful.</p>
      </br>
      <p>This collaborative spirit and the desire to understand how other people think are parts of what drew me to user experience design. The other was how we can use this energy to help make lives a little better and a little easier, whether that&#39;s improving the services of a healthcare app or rearranging a school&#39;s cafeteria space to make getting lunch easier and more enjoyable for all students.</p>
      </br> 
      <p>As a chronic learner who&#39;s always ready to dive into new challenges with gusto, I left my editing job to study User Experience Design full time at General Assembly.</p> 
      </br>
      <p>Want to know how it&#39;s going? Or, if you want to talk about travel or books, please get in touch!</p>
      </br>
      <p>Cheers.
